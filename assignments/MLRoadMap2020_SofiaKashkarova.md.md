# 2020 Machine Learning Roadmap

Machine learning is turning things (data) into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers.

Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

What machine learning is good for?

 - Problems with long lists of rules—when the traditional approach fails, machine learning may help. 
 -  Continually changing environments—machine learning can adapt (‘learn’) to new scenarios. 
 - Discovering insights within large collections of data—can you imagine trying to go through every transaction your (large) company has ever had by hand?
